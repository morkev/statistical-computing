# K Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that tries to cluster data based on 
# their similarity. Unsupervised learning means that there is no outcome to be predicted, 
# and the algorithm just tries to find patterns in the data. 
#
# In k means clustering, we have to specify the number of clusters we want the data to be grouped into. 
# The algorithm randomly assigns each observation to a cluster, and finds the centroid of each cluster. 
#
# Then, the algorithm iterates through two steps:
# a) Reassign data points to the cluster whose centroid is closest.
# b) Calculate new centroid of each cluster.
#
# These two steps are repeated till the within cluster variation cannot be reduced any further. 
# The within cluster variation is calculated as the sum of the euclidean distance between 
# the data points and their respective cluster centroids.

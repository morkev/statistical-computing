# You will always have to pass the minimum required support and confidence.
# We set the minimum support to 0.001
# We set the minimum confidence of 0.8

# We then show the top 5 rules
# Get the rules:

# This reads easily (e.g., if someone buys yogurt and cereals, they are 81% likely to buy whole milk too).
#
# We can get summary info. about the rules that give us some interesting information such as:
# a) The number of rules generated: 410.
# b) The distribution of rules by length: Most rules are 4 items long.
# c) The summary of quality measures: interesting to see ranges of support, lift and confidence.
# d) The information on the data mined: total data mined and minimum parameters.

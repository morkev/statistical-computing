# Distance Measures.
# Euclidean Distance.
#
# The measure of distance is an important tool in statistical analysis. 
# It quantifies dissimilarity between sample data for numerical computation. 
#
# For example, the data frame 'mtcars' consists of measurements from a collection of 32 automobiles.
# Since there are 11 measurement attributes for each automobile, the data set can
# be seen as a collection of 32 sample vectors in an 11 dimensional space.
#
# To find out the dissimilarity between two automobiles, say Honda Civic and Camaro Z28, 
# we can calculate the distance between them with the dist function.

x <- mtcars["Honda Civic",]
y <- mtcars["Camaro Z28",]
dist(rbind(x, y)) 

# --------------------------------------------------------

# Likewise, we can compute the distance between Camaro Z28 and Pontiac Firebird:
z <- mtcars["Pontiac Firebird",]
dist(rbind(x,y,z)) 

# As the distance between Camaro Z28 and Pontiac Firebird (86.267) is smaller than the 
# distance between Camaro Z28 and Honda Civic (335.89), we conclude that Camaro Z28 
# is more similar to Pontiac Firebird than to Honda Civic.

# Manhattan Distance.
dist(rbind(x, y, method = "manhattan")) 
dist(rbind(y, z, method = "manhattan")) 

# Minkowski Distance.

# Alternative Solution
# Instead of using the critical value, we apply the pnorm function 
# to compute the upper tail p-value of the test statistic. 

# If it turns out to be less than .05 we will reject null hypothesis

# One-sample t-test
#
# e.g., an outbreak of Salmonella-related illness was attributed to ice cream produced
# at a certain factory. Scientists measured the level of Salmonella in 9 randomly sampled
# batches of ice cream. The levels (in MPN/g) were:
  
# 0.593 0.142 0.329 0.691 0.231 0.793 0.519 0.392 0.418

# Is there evidence that the mean level of Salmonella
# in the ice cream is greater than 0.3 MPN/g?

# Let 'mu' be the mean level of Salmonella in all batches of ice cream. 
# Here the hypothesis of interest can be expressed as:

H0: mu = 0.3
Ha: mu > 0.3

# Hence, we will need to include the options alternative = "greater", mu = 0.3. 
# Below is the relevant R-code:

x = c(0.593, 0.142, 0.329, 0.691, 0.231, 0.793, 0.519, 0.392, 0.418)
t.test(x, alternative = "greater", mu = 0.3)

# Interpretation:
# From the output we see that the p-value = 0.029. Hence, there is moderately strong
# evidence that the mean Salmonella level in the ice cream is above 0.3 MPN/g.

# --------------------------------------------------------

# Two-sample t-tests
#
# e.g., 6 subjects were given a drug (treatment group) and an additional 6 subjects a
# placebo (control group). Their reaction time to a stimulus was measured (in ms). We
# want to perform a two-sample t-test for comparing the means of the treatment and
# control groups.

# Let 'mu1' be the mean of the population taking medicine and mu2 the mean of the
# untreated population. Here the hypothesis of interest can be expressed as:

H0: mu1 = mu2
Ha: mu1 < mu2

Control = c(91, 87, 99, 77, 88, 91)
Treat = c(101, 110, 103, 93, 99, 104)

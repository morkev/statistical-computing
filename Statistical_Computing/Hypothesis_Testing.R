# Upper Tailed Test.
# --------------------------------------------------------

xbar <- 2.1     # sample mean
mu0 <- 2        # hypothesized value - claim value

sigma <- 0.25
n <- 35

z = (xbar - mu0)/(sigma/sqrt(n))
z  # test statistic

# --------------------------------------------------------

# Let's calculate the critical value at .05 significance level.

alpha <- .05
z.alpha <- qnorm(1-alpha)
z.alpha # critical value

# Test diagnosis shows that test statistic 2.366432 is greater than the critical value 1.6449.
# Therefore, at .05 significance level, we reject the null hypothesis.
#
# i.e., the claim of at most 2 grams of saturated fat in a chips packet should be rejected.

# --------------------------

# Alternative Solution
# Instead of using the critical value, we apply the pnorm function 
# to compute the upper tail p-value of the test statistic. 

# If it turns out to be less than .05, we will reject null hypothesis.

pval <- pnorm(z, lower.tail = FALSE)

# One-Sample t-test
#
# e.g., an outbreak of Salmonella-related illness was attributed to ice cream produced at
# a certain factory. Scientists measured the level of Salmonella in 9 randomly sampled
# batches of ice cream. 

# The levels (in MPN/g) were:
# 0.593 0.142 0.329 0.691 0.231 0.793 0.519 0.392 0.418

# Is there evidence that the mean level of Salmonella 
# in the ice cream is greater than 0.3 MPN/g?


# Let 'mu' be the mean level of Salmonella in all batches of ice cream. 
# Here the hypothesis of interest can be expressed as:
#
# H0: mu = 0.3
# Ha: mu > 0.3
#
# Hence, we will need to include the options alternative = "greater", mu = 0.3. 

# Below is the relevant R-code:
x = c(0.593, 0.142, 0.329, 0.691, 0.231, 0.793, 0.519, 0.392, 0.418)
t.test(x, alternative="greater", mu=0.3)

# Interpretation  
# From the output we see that the p-value = 0.029. Hence, there is moderately strong
# evidence that the mean Salmonella level in the ice cream is above 0.3 MPN/g.

# Two-sample t-tests
#
# e.g., 6 subjects were given a drug (treatment group) and an additional 6 subjects a placebo 
# (control group). Their reaction time to a stimulus was measured (in ms). We want to perform 
# a two-sample t-test for comparing the means of the treatment and control groups.

# Let 'mu1' be the mean of the population taking medicine, and 'mu2' the mean of the untreated
# population. Here the hypothesis of interest can be expressed as:
#
# H0: mu1 = mu2
# Ha: mu1 < mu2

Control = c(91, 87, 99, 77, 88, 91)
Treat = c(101, 110, 103, 93, 99, 104)

t.test(Control,Treat,alternative="less", var.equal=TRUE)

## Chi-Square test

library(MASS)
head(survey)

tbl <- table(survey$Smoke, survey$Exer)
tbl

# Significance level alpha = .05

chisq.test(tbl)

# As the p-value 0.4828 is greater than the .05 significance level, we do not reject the 
# null hypothesis that the smoking habit is independent of the exercise level of the students.
